## Workshop Team
Prof. Fabio Gramazio, Prof. Matthias Kohler, Dr. Romana Rust, Gonzalo Casas, Beverly Lytle, Michael Lyrenmann

## Workshop Description

This workshop will introduce parametric tools and produce light drawings using SJSU's UR robot. The workshop will focus on two areas:

### Generative Design

Using a combination of Rhino, Grasshopper, you will learn how to develop a parametric workflow where you are creating a machine that produces an infinite number of variations of a design. Using Grasshopper you can automate these tasks and explore the larger design space of your ideas. 

### Robotic Drawing

Automation is a power tool in manufacturing and cheaper and safer robots are now available for artists and designer to explore. ....

## Schedule

### Part I: Introduction to Rhino / Grasshopper (Parametric Platform)
date Sept 24th, 17:00-19:00, zoom, 
Wednesday, March 17 8am - 10:30am Pacific Time

In this introduction we will introduce you to Rhino/Grasshopper as a platform and demonstrate the full process from text to curves to robot movement and code.

### Part 2: Offline Practice and Project Development

Between the Part 1 and Part 2, you will all work on your specific project ideas. Feel free to contact us as needed for help. It takes time to learn grasshopper so don't expect to pick it up right away. In addition to watching the recorded video from Part 1, here are a few helpful resources for learning Grasshopper:
