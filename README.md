## Workshop Team

* Prof. Matthias Kohler
* Romana Rust
* Gonzalo Casas
* Beverly Lytle
* Michael Lyrenmann

## Workshop Description

This workshop will introduce parametric tools and produce 360° light drawings using SJSU's [UR5 robot](https://www.universal-robots.com/e-series/) and an [Insta360](https://www.insta360.com/) camera. The workshop will focus on two areas:

* Generative Design

    Using a combination of Rhino, Grasshopper and custom python tools, you will learn how to develop a parametric workflow to explore an infinite number of variations of a light design. We will provide you with a visualisation tool to anticipate how your 360° light drawing will look like.

* Robotic Light Drawing

    We will bring custom-made light tools for different light *strokes* to create the 360° light paintings. You will test different light tools, learn how to automate tasks and plan for safe robot motions. 


## Light Tools

We will bring different light tools with different autfsätze that allow you to control your light stroke. this can reach from a single dot, to a line , a diffuse light and the change of colors.
We will provide tools to easily adjust light intensity and color. (on the fly)

## Outcome
* 360 Video to view on in a browser
* picture for exhibition
* video of creation

## Schedule

### Part I: Introduction to Rhino / Grasshopper (Parametric Platform)

Date Friday, Sept 24th 2021, 17:00 - 19:00 CEST, on Zoom 
pacific time? 8am - 10:30am Pacific Time

In this introduction we will introduce you to Rhino/Grasshopper as a platform and demonstrate the full process from creating of curves to robot movement in simulation.
We will record this lecture so you can watch it later on.


### Part 2: Offline Practice and Project Development

Between the Part 1 and Part 3, you will all work on your specific project ideas. Feel free to contact us via Slack as needed for help. It takes time to learn grasshopper so don't expect to pick it up right away. In addition to watching the recorded video from Part 1, here are a few helpful resources for learning Grasshopper.

Here are a few videos by the creator of Grasshopper, David Rutten:

If you want a more in-depth grasshopper handbook, Modelab has created an excellent book with example files:

# Files

We will share the main tools and files via this repository.

Our presentaton and useful links can also be found on the [MIRO board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lwOiOCk=/)

# Communication

# Platforms

## Software

### Git


### Rhino

We will be using Rhino as the primary platform. 

If you don't have it already, you can download a 90-day free evaluation version of Rhino 7 here:

[Windows 90-day Evaluation](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-windows/evaluation)

[MacOS 90-day Evaluation](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-mac/evaluation)

### Grasshopper

[Grasshopper](https://www.rhino3d.com/features/#grasshopper) is a plugin for Rhino, and as of version 7, is installed by default in both the Mac and Windows versions. To open Grasshopper within Rhino, simply type "Grasshopper" in the command line or click the Grasshopper icon in the Standard toolbar (second from far right, green circle with insect).

### Grasshopper Plugins

One of the best things about Grasshopper is the massive ecosystem of third-party plugins. However, Grasshopper plugins can sometimes be difficult to install. However, things are getting better with Rhino 7. You should be able to use the Rhino Command "PackageManager" to open up the new Rhino package manager and install the plugins from the web.

### Illustrator

You can import or export vector art between Rhino and Illustrator. You can also copy/paste between Rhino and Illustrator, although I don't recommend it for larger files.
